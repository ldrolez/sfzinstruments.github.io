## Story
> I’m a Glasgow based producer/composer called Richard Luke and was scoring
a short animated film using this great Steinway Model D Concert Grand,
located in a nearby church in Glasgow. I decided to have a crack at sampling it
which is my first foray into piano sampling (thanks pianobook) It’s delicate
and glassy and you can really sense the acoustic of the space it was recorded in.
