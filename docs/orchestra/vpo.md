Virtual Playing Orchestra now consists of 2 parts: wave files and scripts.
These two things work together. The scripts configure the use of the wave files.
You need to download the “Wave Files” plus at least one of the
“Standard Orchestra” sfz scripts or the “Performance Orchestra” sfz scripts
(depending on how you want to control the sounds) then unzip each zip file in
the same place and in the same way as you did with the wave files, or wherever
your DAW (digital audio workstation) can find the files you unzip. Either way,
all .zip files need to be unzipped in the same place and in the same way
(i.e. extract the .zip files into the same sub-directory,
“Virtual-Playing-Orchestra3” for example).
