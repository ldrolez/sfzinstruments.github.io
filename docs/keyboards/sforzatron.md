> In order to offer a different approach, we built it with simultaneous playback
of three tapes, each with it’s own ADSR envelope, pan, volume and fine tune.
To top it off, a smooth overdrive can be added to the whole mix!
It comes with a fresh pack of 34 presets ranging from the classic to the unusual.
You’ll be surprised how well it can fit in just about any musical genre once you
start layering all those different tones.
Mac users, this bank takes advantage of Sforzando’s newly supported
Retina display capability. Looks sharp!
